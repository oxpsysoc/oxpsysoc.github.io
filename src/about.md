_Welcome to the Oxford Psychedelics Society! If you are reading this, then you must be curious about our society. We are home to researchers, artists, and students who believe in the transformative potential of psychedelics._

_I‚Äôve been told that when OPS began it was a small group of psychedelic enthusiasts coming together for pub conversations, and now many years later it has evolved into one of the most active societies at the University of Oxford. During academic term times, OPS holds weekly lectures about psychedelics, bringing speakers from all over the world to discuss the latest scientific research, but also any other topic that intersects with psychedelics, whether that be art, culture or history. OPS also holds regular holistic events like sound baths and meditation that aims to promote sober human flourishing and mindful awareness, akin to psychedelics. We also know how to throw a rave or two. These events are held for this community, for bringing people together, for creating open discussions that keep our society moving forward. I hope that you find what you‚Äôre looking for here at the Oxford Psychedelic society._

\- Sylvana Vilca-Melendez, OPS President üçÑüíö

As founders and representatives of psychedelic societies across the globe, we assert that people have a basic liberty and freedom to responsibly use psychedelic substances: for healing, for growth, for fun, and for personal, collective and spiritual exploration.

We work to secure these rights in collaboration with allies within social, political and scientific institutions.

We support changes to existing national and international laws and governmental policies which would decriminalize and reschedule psychedelics, allowing for proper research and safe regulated access, to stop pushing people into clandestine practices and the risks of the black market and the penal system.

We resolve to change the cultural dialogue surrounding psychedelic substances to accurately reflect what is known, and steer it towards more productive and compassionate conclusions through education and information.

Like mushrooms emerging after the rain, the global network of psychedelic societies is rising up as a public forum and voice for all the people who appreciate psychedelics.

## Social Events
<img class="bordered autoscale float-right mobile-only" src="/static/img/about/duality_poster.jpg" width="200"/>

Throughout the academic year, we organise social events such as social gatherings and movie nights. Everyone is welcome!

Our biggest social event yet took place in June 2024. We organised Duality, an immersive music, dance, and art event in Cowley Workers Social Club. We explored the concept of duality through a party packed full of psychedelic visuals, live music, DJ sets, decor, and performances, spanning two rooms.
